1. Provide a DNF construction for a function f such that the maximum term size is equal to the 1-certificate
complexity for f. 
A. Let S be the set of all 1-certificates of f. Mark each bit position as xi. If, for a particular certificate, 
xi = 0, then mark it as NOT xi, else leave it as xi. Now construct a DNF by AND-ing the variables in each certificate
according to the above scheme, and OR-ing all these terms to form a DNF formula f. The maximum term size in this
case will be the size of the 1-certificate complexity. 


2. Explain the DNF algorithm for proving that D(f) is bounded by C^2(f).
A. 


3. Provide decision trees for each of the examples given in B&A.

4. Complete the exercises provided in DT.
