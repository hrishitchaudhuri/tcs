Q. For every k âˆˆ N, let fk be the AND-OR function on strings of length 2^k (see Example 12.2). Prove
that D(fk) = 2^k.

A. The decision-tree is capable of evaluating the output deterministically based on each input bit. In
the worst case, it has to evaluate every single bit before it can decide the output. This can be proven
using an adversarial argument to generate the string that will require all its bits decided before the 
tree can provide a solution. 

This generation can be done trivially. For instance, consider f2, consisting of 1 AND level and 1 OR level. 
In this case, the string 0100 will require all four bits to be processed, giving a decision tree complexity
of 4.
