Q. Suppose f is any function that depends on all its bits; in other words, for each bit position i
there is an input x such that f(x) != f(xi). Show that s(f) = â„¦(log n).

A. Since f depends on all its bits, each of these bits MUST be queried by the decision tree deciding
f. However, the shape of the tree will depend on the sensitivity of f, since, for the decision tree 
to correctly determine the unique output of the function given an input x, it MUST query all the 
sensitive bits of x. Therefore, the ideal construction gives us a balanced binary decision tree, under
the lower-bound assumption of S, causing each input to have a maximum sensitivity of log n.
